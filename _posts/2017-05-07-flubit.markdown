**Brief**

Online marketplace Flubit.com wanted to use PR to reinforce their marketing activity, with an aim to increase brand awareness and site traffic.

**Creativity & Execution**

Capitalizing on the news agenda and consumer hooks, articles were produced to position Flubit as a money saving alternative to Amazon. Additional stories were produced in line with targeted verticals of the site, to drive further sales within these categories.

Flubit was also profiled on a B2B level to showcase the company to the wider business community. Personnel profiling and thought leadership articles were placed in selected titles, to strengthen Flubitâ€™s position as an influential UK startup.
