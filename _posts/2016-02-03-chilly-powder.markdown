**Brief**

A family owned collection of ski chalets in the French Alps, Chilly Powder wanted to use PR to showcase their offering as both a summer and winter holiday destination.

**Creativity & Execution**

Boasting a genuine ski to door location, unrivaled childcare facilities and an in-house Cordon Bleu Chef, Chilly Powder has a lot of angles to play with. Individual and bespoke press trips were created for journalists, with every visit tailored to showcase the chalets in line with the interests of each respective outlet. Alongside national coverage, articles were also placed to drive bookings during Chilly Powder’s ‘off peak’ booking period, with outlets being targeted based on the demographic and geographic placement of their readership.
