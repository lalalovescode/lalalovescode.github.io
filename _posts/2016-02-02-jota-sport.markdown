**Brief**

Former winners of the prestigious Le Mans 24 Hour Race, JOTA Sport looked to increase their profile and promote the achievements of their team before competing in the FIA World Endurance Championships in 2016.

**Creativity & Execution**

Working closely with the team and international sponsors, key information behind the design and engineering of the cars was offered to selected titles. The teamâ€™s drivers were also profiled individually, with weekly interviews conducted with the youngest member of the team. This generated content was later developed into a blogs series published by the Huffington Post.
